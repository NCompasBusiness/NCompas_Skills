## Key Decisions Made

1. **Focus on Greenfield vs Brownfield** - Not company size (small/medium/large)
2. **Use pizza slice analogy** - Show how AI Native reduces team size (2 pizza team → 1 slice)
3. **Shift-left methodology** - Developers move to understand business, agents write code
4. **Plugin structure** - Encompasses skills, commands, agents, hooks, and MCPs
5. **Templates are IP** - Skills and plugins are the new intellectual property
6. **Context engineering is critical** - Efficient token usage through skill structure

---

## Key Concepts Discussed

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - Protocol for agents to talk to other agents/databases/tools
- **Skills** - Knowledge/documentation that guides Claude on how to perform tasks
- **Tools** - External capabilities (like Railway CLI, Playwright) that skills can leverage
- **Commands** - Custom prompts that define workflow steps
- **Plugins** - Package containing skills, commands, agents, hooks, and MCP configs
- **REPL Loop** - Read, Eval, Print, Loop for autonomous development
- **Context Engineering** - Optimizing token usage by loading only needed context

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Sahiti to watch recording again and revise presentation
2. **Today**: Prince to create SOW plugin and share video
3. **Short-term**: Team to form and start building Encompass templates
4. **Ongoing**: Everyone stay active in group chat, hands-on learning
